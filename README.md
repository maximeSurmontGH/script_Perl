# SCRIPTS PERL

PERL, Unix commans

Find here some scripts I wrote, mostly to train myself but I think they can be useful! So use them if you need! Just don't forget you need perl on your desk, you may have to change the hash bang (or shebang) line (the first one, normally you shouldn t have to) and do not hesitate to make a pr if you make improvements!
